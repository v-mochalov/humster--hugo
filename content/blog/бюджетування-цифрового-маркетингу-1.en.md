## Digital Marketing

Within the budget is an important task for many companies. Regardless of the business size, everyone wants their product or service to be visible to potential customers, but it's not always possible to allocate huge amounts of money for advertising.

However, there's no need to despair because there are plenty of ways to attract potential customers' attention without breaking the budget. If you're just starting out in marketing, **digital marketing budgeting** will be an important task for you.

The first step is to define the goals and objectives you want to achieve. If you want to increase sales, you can do so through social media. In Instagram and Facebook, you can place ads targeted only at your intended audience. This will help reduce advertising costs and increase its effectiveness.

If you have a small budget, you can start with small investments in contextual advertising on search engines such as Yandex or Google. Determine keywords that could potentially bring customers to your website. However, don't forget that choosing keywords is crucial, and you should pay enough attention to it.

If you're unsure which keywords to choose, you can use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Yandex.Metrica. They will help you select keywords that are most suitable for your business and will be most effective.

Another way to attract customers is through email marketing. This is a cheap and effective way to promote your business. You can send newsletters with news about your company, as well as with discounts and promotions. However, don't overuse this method, or you might end up being marked as spam, which could harm your business.
